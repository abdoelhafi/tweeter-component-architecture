# twitter-microservices-based-architecture

> This is a simple school assignement for componenent based architecture. It was made using Jhipster. you can find the final result in `DOCKERHUB`.
> I will provide the links to each ressource in the following readme how to use this repo guide.

## How to use this code.

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [`docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
2. Move to directory named `docker-compose`.
```sh
$ cd docker-compose
```
3. run the following command.
```sh
$ docker-compose up -d`
```
To save time you can use the images provided in `DOCKERHUB`. To do so you need only to add the user name kotbymo infront of the name "kotbymo" of every service image in the `docker-compose.yml`.
